Thanks for downloading and checking out this asset set.

A few years ago I was working on a sci-fi adventure game with some friends when I stopped to focus my work on a speculative fiction novel. Instead of keeping this work private I figured it’d be better to share this with a community that might be able to take what I did and make something cool from what I started. You keep making games and I’ll keep writing books. You can find out more about my recent novel at: thestarswereright.kmalexander.com — please check it out!

I hope you find this a decent base for you to build on.  I’d love to see what you do with this, feel free to email me: hello@kmalexander.com and let me know what you make!
