Thanks for downloading and/or checking out the SCI-FI ASSET PACK.

A few years ago I was working on a sci-fi adventure game with some friends when I stopped to focus my work on a urban fantasy thriller novel THE STARS WERE RIGHT. Which each went our own way and the team eventually disbanded. Recently I came across the assets and figured  instead of keeping all my work private and hidden away it’d be better to share it with a community that might be able to take what I did and make something cool from what I started.

In this set you'll find exterior construction elements for the interior of the space station, as well as building interiors ranging from bars, hospitals, churches, offices, houses, bathrooms, and more. Nearly a thousand images for you to use for FREE.

I hope you find this a decent base for you to build on. I’d love to see what you do with this, feel free to email me: hello@kmalexander.com and let me know what you make!

You keep making great games and I’ll keep writing books.
