Thanks for downloading and checking out the SKYHOOK ASSET PACK.

A few years ago I was working on a sci-fi adventure game with some friends when I stopped to focus my work on a urban fantasy thriller novel. Since the work stopped and the team disbanded I decided that instead of keeping all the work private it’d be better to share it with a community that might be able to take what I did and make something cool from what I started.

I hope you find this a decent base for you to build on.  I’d love to see what you do with this, feel free to email me: hello@kmalexander.com and let me know what you make!


You keep making great games and I’ll keep writing books.
